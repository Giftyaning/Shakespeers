## User Story (temporary)
* Users load the page
* Users are given option to select a Shakespeare play from a dropdown list (rules of how to use the site also on landing page)
* On click - a random quotation from chosen play is generated in nice, readable card
* Users are prompted to fill in boxes with their knowledge on the following areas, in relation to the quotation:
        * Key contextual details
        * Literary Features (within the randomly selected lines)
        * Shakespeare's Authorial Intent
        * Themes
* The user can click on a 'help me' button for each of the above - a randomly generated fact will appear to support them (the user will be told that the generated facts may or not relate to their quotation - they can keep clicking until they know the fact is useful)
* Once the user has completed their ideas (or not), they can enter both their own email and the email of a peer or teacher to forward their answers to
